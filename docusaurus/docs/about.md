_SIS Tools_ is an application designed to ease a few of the integration pain points commonly experienced when launching as a _teaching college_ in the [OEI Course Exchange](https://cvc.edu/oei-course-exchange/) for California Community Colleges. Unifying the processes involved under a common executable can assist an institution with onboarding faster into the program.

It is SIS agnostic, and will support Banner, Colleague, and PeopleSoft as the number of colleges participating in phase 2 of the program increases.
